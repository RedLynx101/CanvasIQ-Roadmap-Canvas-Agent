## 🎯 What is CanvasIQ?

CanvasIQ is a conversational AI agent that helps organizations plan and prioritize their AI investments. Through an intelligent interview process, it captures your AI use cases, automatically calculates financial metrics, helps you build an optimized portfolio, and generates a complete **AI ROI & Roadmap Canvas**—a single-page strategic document ready for executive presentations.

### The Problem

Organizations struggle to:
- Quantify the ROI of AI initiatives before investing
- Prioritize competing AI projects with limited budgets
- Create cohesive multi-year AI roadmaps
- Communicate AI strategy to stakeholders effectively

### The Solution

CanvasIQ provides a structured, AI-guided approach to strategic planning that transforms vague AI ambitions into data-driven investment decisions with clear financial justification.

```
Hi! I'm the CTO at Tartan Solutions, a mid-sized manufacturing company in the automotive parts industry. We have about 2,000 employees and $150M in annual revenue. Our budget for AI initiatives this year is $1.5 million.

We're looking to implement AI across several areas. Let me share our top use cases:

1. Predictive Quality Control - We have a 3% defect rate that costs us $2M annually in rework and returns. We believe AI vision systems could reduce this to under 1%. Implementation would cost around $400K with $80K annual maintenance. This is high impact but requires significant effort to integrate with our production lines.

2. Demand Forecasting - Our inventory carrying costs are $1.5M/year due to poor forecasting. An ML model could improve accuracy by 25%, saving $500K annually. Cost: $150K implementation, $40K/year. Medium effort, medium-high impact.

3. Chatbot for Supplier Inquiries - Our procurement team spends 30% of time on routine supplier questions. A chatbot could save $300K in labor annually. Cost: $80K implementation, $20K/year. Low effort, medium impact.

4. Predictive Maintenance for CNC Machines - Unplanned downtime costs us $800K/year. Predictive maintenance could reduce this by 60%. Cost: $250K implementation, $60K/year. High effort and high impact, but depends on IoT sensor installation.

5. Document Processing for Compliance - We spend $400K/year on manual compliance document review. AI could automate 70% of this. Cost: $120K implementation, $30K/year. Low effort, high impact.

Can you help me analyze these and build our AI roadmap?

## 📐 ROI Formulas

### Basic ROI
```
ROI = (Annual Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100
```

### Net Present Value (NPV)
```
NPV = Σ (Cash Flow / (1 + 0.10)^t) - Initial Investment
```
*Where t = years (1 to 3)*

### Payback Period
```
Payback (months) = Implementation Cost / Monthly Net Benefit
```

### Risk-Adjusted Value
```
Value = NPV × Risk Multiplier × (Impact Score / Effort Score)
```
*Risk Multipliers: Low = 1.0, Medium = 0.8, High = 0.6*

## Data boundary

- Interview messages are sent to OpenAI when the AI interview is used.
- Company context, use cases, budgets, and generated canvas state are persisted in the current browser's local storage.
- The public demo is not a confidential planning environment and does not provide organizational tenancy or an account boundary. Use synthetic or non-sensitive inputs.
- The ROI and payback figures shown on the landing page are illustrative examples. Generated results depend on the assumptions supplied by the user and are not investment or implementation guarantees.
