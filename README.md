```
Hi! I'm the CTO at Tartan Solutions, a mid-sized manufacturing company in the automotive parts industry. We have about 2,000 employees and $150M in annual revenue. Our budget for AI initiatives this year is $1.5 million.

We're looking to implement AI across several areas. Let me share our top use cases:

1. Predictive Quality Control - We have a 3% defect rate that costs us $2M annually in rework and returns. We believe AI vision systems could reduce this to under 1%. Implementation would cost around $400K with $80K annual maintenance. This is high impact but requires significant effort to integrate with our production lines.

2. Demand Forecasting - Our inventory carrying costs are $1.5M/year due to poor forecasting. An ML model could improve accuracy by 25%, saving $500K annually. Cost: $150K implementation, $40K/year. Medium effort, medium-high impact.

3. Chatbot for Supplier Inquiries - Our procurement team spends 30% of time on routine supplier questions. A chatbot could save $300K in labor annually. Cost: $80K implementation, $20K/year. Low effort, medium impact.

4. Predictive Maintenance for CNC Machines - Unplanned downtime costs us $800K/year. Predictive maintenance could reduce this by 60%. Cost: $250K implementation, $60K/year. High effort and high impact, but depends on IoT sensor installation.

5. Document Processing for Compliance - We spend $400K/year on manual compliance document review. AI could automate 70% of this. Cost: $120K implementation, $30K/year. Low effort, high impact.

Can you help me analyze these and build our AI roadmap?

## 📐 ROI Formulas

### Basic ROI
```
ROI = (Annual Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100
```

### Net Present Value (NPV)
```
NPV = Σ (Cash Flow / (1 + 0.10)^t) - Initial Investment
```
*Where t = years (1 to 3)*

### Payback Period
```
Payback (months) = Implementation Cost / Monthly Net Benefit
```

### Risk-Adjusted Value
```
Value = NPV × Risk Multiplier × (Impact Score / Effort Score)
```
*Risk Multipliers: Low = 1.0, Medium = 0.8, High = 0.6*
